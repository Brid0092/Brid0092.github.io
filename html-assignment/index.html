        <Header>About Me</Header>
<paragraph>Hey! I'm Alice and I'm origionally from Fredericton, New Brunswick. I moved to Ottawa about two years ago now in search of a different adventure.
    I had a very detailed plan about how I wanted to live my life and how I was going to accomplish things. Little did I know my plans where going to go completly
    off rail. In one of the most unpredictable and amazing ways ever. In my first week of living in Ottawa i got my first full time job, it was great for a little 
    while but later rather then sooner I realized I could be a full time student and work full time while paying rent. I had to chose, and unfortunalty my only realistic 
    choice was too keep working. If I didnt I wouldn't have been able to sustain myself. I sturggled really bad at first, having to bus two hours a day at four in the 
    morning just to get to work on time. Then, having a two hour bus drive back home, my days would start at 4 and end at 6. Everyday I was exhausted and I couldnt keep 
    myself happy and healthy.

<paragraph>That is, till I meet my amazing partner. We knew eachother for quite some time since we worked in that same department. They were the first person to be nice 
    to me and we just kinda click since the first encounter. Unfortuatly, we had an abusive boss how would yell at me to stop talking to all the other staff, and at one point i wasnt even allowed in their 
    fasinity, even thought everyone else could talk all day to each other, I wasnt allowed too. It came to point where I really had to stand up for myself so I went to
    the HR and told them everything that was happening, nothing happened to the manager but I got transfered into another department. And honestly it was the best outcome over. One, because i ended up 
    in the most amazing department with an incredible manager and assistant managers and two, that coworker and I needed up togther and weve been living together for a little 
    over a year know. My mental health has never been better and I'm finally starting to follow my dreams.
